			<p>Hopefully this will be a lexicon of clouds with interactive clouds flying above it in Augmenty Reality. Let's see.</p>
			<h2>What kind of clouds? </h2>
			<p>Cirrus clouds are short, detached, hair-like clouds found at high altitudes. These delicate clouds are wispy, with a silky sheen, or look like tufts of hair. In the daytime, they are whiter than any other cloud in the sky. While the Sun is setting or rising, they may take on the colours of the sunset.
			</p>
			<p>Cumulus clouds are clouds which have flat bases and are often described as "puffy", "cotton-like" or "fluffy" in appearance. Their name derives from the Latin cumulo-, meaning heap or pile.</p>
